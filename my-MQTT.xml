    MQTT for Unraid6 Docker Manager running on Port 1883 and 9001[br][br]&#xD;
    MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. [br]&#xD;
    It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. [br]&#xD;
    It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required [br]&#xD;
    and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. For example, it has been used in sensors [br]&#xD;
    communicating to a broker via satellite link, over occasional dial-up connections with [br]&#xD;
    healthcare providers, and in a range of home automation and small device scenarios. [br]&#xD;
    It is also ideal for mobile applications because of its small size, low power usage, [br]&#xD;
    minimised data packets, and efficient distribution of information to one or many receivers[br]&#xD;
    [br][br][br]&#xD;
    This version supports passwords - see passwords.README in the /config directory.[br]&#xD;
    Also supported are websockets and certificates.[br]&#xD;
    [br]&#xD;
    The docker is built on a LinuxServer.io template, but be assured that any bugs are mine!.[br]&#xD;
